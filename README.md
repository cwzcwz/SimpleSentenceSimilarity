# SimpleSentenceSimilarity
Word embeddings have become widespread in Natural Language Processing. They allow us to easily compute the semantic similarity between two words, or to find the words most similar to a target word. However, in many applications we're more interested in the similarity between two sentences or short texts. In this notebook, I compare some simple ways of computing sentence similarity and investigate how they perform.
